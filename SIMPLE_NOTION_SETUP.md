# Simple Notion Setup Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Create Your Notion Database
In Notion, create a new database with these **8 simple fields**:

| Field Name | Type | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| **Title** | Title | Project name |
| **Location** | Text | Where (e.g., "Bondi Beach, NSW") |
| **Type** | Select | Choose: Residential, Commercial, Renovation, Extension |
| **Story** | Text | 2-3 sentences about the project |
| **Hero Image** | Files | Main project photo |
| **Gallery Images** | Files | 4-6 project photos |
| **Video URL** | URL | YouTube/Vimeo link (optional) |
| **Featured** | Checkbox | Show on homepage? |

That's it! Much simpler than before.
